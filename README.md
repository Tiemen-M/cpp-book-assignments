# cpp-book-assignments
Files produced during learning c++
## Abstract
During the period 26 september 2023 to 26 december 2023, I have learned the
programming language C++ by a book named "Aan de slag met c++". This repo contains manual
retyped examples from that book with changes, elaborations of book assignments and experiments.
The c++ files are compatable with the MS c++ compiler (gnu c++ compiler did not work).
